# # Developing a D-Wave Leap application, from problem selection to model implementation

# This notebook demonstrates an end to end process for users to develop D-Wave Leap application, from selecting a problem, through domain analysis to first model implementation.
# The process is simulated using a paper from the literature as a proxy for the problem owner. This is done enable reproducibility while protecting privacy of users.
# Only the problem motivation and description from the paper is used. The formulation & implementation are developed independently to illustrate a practical approach to the process.
# Inline quotes from the paper should be read as a problem owner's responses to developer inquiries. Quotes are sometimes reused when they answer multiple questions.

# ## Problem Selection

# The paper [Kowalik P, Rzemieniak M. Binary Linear Programming as a Tool of Cost Optimization for a Water Supply Operator. Sustainability. 2021 13(6):3470.](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13063470) was selected. An annotated CC-licensed [copy](./sustainability-13-03470-v2.pdf) is provided It was chosen based on criteria discussed below. It builds on the prior [Kozłowski, E., Mazurkiewicz, D., Kowalska, B., Kowalski, D. (2018). Binary Linear Programming as a Decision-Making Aid for Water Intake Operators.

# ### Is this a real problem?
# -

# > Supplying high-quality water at a competitive cost is a major challenge for water utilities worldwide, especially with ever-increasing water quality standards and energy prices [1,2]. Water supply systems are among the most important parts of infrastructure necessary to provide suitable quality of life for human beings.

# > The issues of water production optimization and energy savings are part of the topic of sustainable development. 

# + [markdown] jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed=true tags=[]
# ### What is the ROI of solving this problem?
# -

# > There are many kinds of costs connected with water supplies. Among them, costs of electric power make an important share of operating costs because of using many electric-powered pumps necessary to bring water from its source or sources to customers
#
# Based on the provided data, the power cost of operating all the pumps constanly is 288.30555 2015-USD per day, which is a very loose upper bound.
# There is no data to quantify other benefits of optimization, such as reduced risk of reservoir constraint violations and reduced labor costs, if the pump scheduling were manual.

# ### Is there complete data for a self contained problem instance?
# Complete data for pump capacities and power requirements as well as hourly water demand predictions and power costs are provided.
#
# > The capacities and values of the electric power of the pumps are presented in Table 1
#
# > The supplier of electric power does not use the same rate per MWh in its pricing policy all day long. Instead, it uses three tariff levels (see Table 2). 
#
# > The example numerical data of the demand values for 24 timeslots of just one specific day are presented in Table 3 (along with corresponding electric power prices).

# ### What is the source of complexity?
# > Various prices of electric power make efficient controlling of the pumps much moredifficult because the requirements resulting from the demand levels as well as technical and safety conditions should be satisfied at the lowest cost.

# ### Who is the problem owner?

# + [markdown] tags=[]
# > The water supply system under consideration is that of a water supply operator based in a town with a population of about 25,000 inhabitants, located in Eastern Poland.
# -

# ### What is the current solution to this problem?
# > An example containing real-world input data was successfully solved using Microsoft Excel with a free OpenSolver add-in.
#
# This would be a red flag in a real commercial application, as there is little benefit in a quantum implementation of a problem that is solved to optimality with a free Excel plugin.
# This does affect the pedagigical value of this  problem and it is treated as a green field problem for the purposes of this exercise.

# ## Problem Description

# From [Kowalik P, Rzemieniak M. Binary Linear Programming as a Tool of Cost Optimization for a Water Supply Operator. Sustainability. 2021 13(6):3470.](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13063470)

# > In order to optimize the operation of a water pumping station itself, it is necessary to create a pump schedule for some period of time (e.g., 24 h) that states when a given pump should be turned on and, if it is controllable, with what efficiency it should work (full capacity or below). Correct optimization requires defining many necessary constraints, including taking into account the predicted demand for water, which varies throughout the day, capacities of reservoir tanks and minimal volumes of water stored in them, costs of electrical power, etc.

# > **The objective of the article is the minimization of the cost of electric power used by the pumps supplying water.**
#
# > The water supply system under consideration is that of a water supply operator based in a town with a population of about 25,000 inhabitants, located in Eastern Poland. **The main parts of the system are wells, pumps, a reservoir tank, and the distribution pipeline network.**
#
# > Supplied water is groundwater pumped from 7 wells. **The capacities and values of the electric power of the pumps are presented** in Table 1. **Water is pumped from the wells to a single reservoir tank with the capacity of Vmax** = 1500 m3 (the maximal volume of stored water).
#
# > **The demand for water varies over time**. **The outflow of water from the reservoir tank via the distribution network to customers is a continuous process.** For practical reasons, **predictions of demand are made for 24 one-hour timeslots**.
#
# > Controlling the pumps must obey the following requirements. **The pumps can operate with their nominal capacities only**, and the amount of water pumped by any pump depends on the time of operation only. **Each pump must operate for at least one hour per day.** Additionally, **at least one well and the pump integrated with it must be kept as a reserve at any moment of the day**. **The water inside the tank should be replaced at least once per day**. During standard operational conditions, **the volume of water in the reservoir tank cannot be less than Vmin** = 523.5 m3. It is the firefighting reserve, which is kept in order to satisfy an extra demand when a fire is extinguished by using water supplied from hydrants.
#
# > ... **the supplier of electric power does not use the same rate per MWh in its pricing** policy all day long. Instead, it uses three tariff levels ...
#
# > Various prices of electric power make efficient controlling of the pumps much moredifficult because the requirements resulting from the demand levels as well as technical and safety conditions should be satisfied at the lowest cost.
#
# > As it has already been mentioned above, a basically continuous process of water distribution is approximately described in a discrete form, namely by specifying 24 predicted values of the demand for 24 one-hour times slots.
#
# >  ... **in each timeslot, each pump can either be used or not**.

# #### *The water inside the tank should be replaced at least once per day (?)*

# This constraint illustrates a common the need for working with engaged problem owners. The meaning of the constraint is unclear. The only known means of removing water from the reservoir is user demand, which is not under the control of the operator. The solution in the paper also does not explicitly enforce this constraint. In a real scenario this would require further discussion with the problem owner.

# #### *The outflow of water from the reservoir tank via the distribution network to customers is a continuous process*
